**General Notes**

This repository details an `onlinecourse` app that has been built across various assignments as a part of the course: IBM Django Application Development with SQL Databases.

The app has various functionalities:
- Maintaining records of Courses available and enrolled for a given user
- Mapping the Instructor and Learners for a Course
- Providing a Login/Signup function for Users to track their activities
- Administering a Quiz for an enrolled Course, with storage and tracking of results
- As Admin, registering new Courses, Instructors, Learners and Assignments
